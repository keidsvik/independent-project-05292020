          <p id="about">From a emotionally intelligent funeral attendant dedicated to meaningful, empathetic service, to a tech-savvy web developer. Right now I am learning how to code at Epicodus. My prior experience in emotionally sensitive fields has me naturally able to work with a large number of different people and personalities, and has put me in a position where I'm used to a constantly changing and challenging work environment. I volunteer with my local Burning Man community, creating art and working during the festival.
            I'm excited about a career change and to dive headlong into coding.

        on Sunday morning when I was playing the organ for tent- show evangelists at the other end of the

        God to forgive them and purge them of carnal desires. And the next Saturday night they'd be back 
        at the carnival or some other place of indulgence.
