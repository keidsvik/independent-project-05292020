          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p id="about">"On Saturday night I would see men lusting after half -naked girls dancing at the carnival, and 
        on Sunday morning when I was playing the organ for tent- show evangelists at the other end of the 
        carnival lot, I would see these same men sitting in the pews with their wives and children, asking 
        God to forgive them and purge them of carnal desires. And the next Saturday night they'd be back 
        at the carnival or some other place of indulgence. 
        
        "I knew then that the Christian Church thrives on hypocrisy, and that man 's carnal nature will 
        out!"
