    <h2>About me</h1>
    <p>"On Saturday night I would see men lusting after half -naked girls dancing at the carnival, and 
      on Sunday morning when I was playing the organ for tent- show evangelists at the other end of the 
      carnival lot, I would see these same men sitting in the pews with their wives and children, asking 
      God to forgive them and purge them of carnal desires. And the next Saturday night they'd be back 
      at the carnival or some other place of indulgence. 
      
      "I knew then that the Christian Church thrives on hypocrisy, and that man 's carnal nature will 
      out!"
